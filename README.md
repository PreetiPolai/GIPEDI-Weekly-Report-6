## GIPEDI WEEKLY INTERACTION

<p align = "justify">The weekly interaction for week 6 was held on July 18, 2021. The discussion was associated with the importance of creating a requirement and specification sheet for every task. The creation of these sheets gives a road map for every activity. It ensures successful and smooth completion of the same. </p>



## STORAGE OF SENSOR DATA IN THE SQL TABLE

<p align = "justify">In the android application - 'Stride,' I have implemented the Room for the three significant sensors - Accelerometer, Magnetometer and Gyroscope. In the application, a separate database has been created for each of these sensors. Each recorded data consists of the Date of capture, timestamp, sensor values measured in [X, Y, Z] coordinates and the total net reading of the sensor. The recorded data is being stored in SQL tables. I have increased the data acquisition rate to 100hz, which is near about 6000 readings in 1min.</p>

## ONE-TO-ONE INTERACTION WITH STUDENT MENTOR

<p align = "justify">The one-to-one interaction with the student mentor Mr. Bodhibrata Mukhopadhyay was held on July 23, 2020. The discussion was on the further improvements that must be done in the android application. However, there were few significant points discussed in the interaction:</p>

- Collection of Data on event basis - Walking, Running and others
- Creation of a separate database for each of these activities
- Naming the SQL tables in accordance to the User
- Generation of the CSV file for each activity by default 



## TASKS FOR NEXT WEEK

<p align = "justify">The major goal for the coming week is the implementation of the separate database for a particular event in android application  In android, we use room to store the data internally, that has to be predefined during the programming. Hence, achieving this will be a significant task.</p>
